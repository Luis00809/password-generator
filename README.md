# password-generator

## Description
 created the password generator to produce a randompassword. The application prompts the user for a desired length and the type of characters they would like. While working on this application, I learned that when the user is prompted and inputs a value, the assigned varibale to that prompt is the exact value.

## Credits
I ended up being confused on how to connect the characters to include in the password and so I seeked help from my bootcamp tutor (Katie Redford). Katie pointed me in the direction of using an array of desired characters to be added to the specified password.
