# password-generator

## Description
 created the password generator to produce a randompassword. The application prompts the user for a desired length and the type of characters they would like. While working on this application, I learned that when the user is prompted and inputs a value, the assigned varibale to that prompt is the exact value.

 ## Installation 
N/A

## Usage
The created passoword generator can be used by anyone seeking a random password. The user can provide input to specify what characters they want in their passowrd. 

The password generator can be accessed at: https://luis00809.github.io/password-generator/


And here is a preview of the application:

## Credits
I ended up being confused on how to connect the characters to include in the password and so I seeked help from my bootcamp tutor (Katie Redford). Katie pointed me in the direction of using an array of desired characters to be added to the specified password.
